# beamerthemeMilano
Milano, an effective and modern beamer theme designed to deliver outstanding (scientific) talks.
Heavily insipired by the great material provided by Jean-luc Doumont, that you can find at [https://principiae.be](https://principiae.be/X0303.php), including his awesome book "Tree, maps, theorem".

Based on the beamer them "Verona", its uses the awesome "Fira" font family (used by Firefox too).
Due to the font family used, it **does not compiles under pdfLaTeX**.
It compiles under **LauLaTeX only**. This makes no practical different to my experience.
To compile with LauLaTeX, just chaned the compiler of the editor you are using.

Does this theme has options?
Not at all! But for intelligent reasons.
